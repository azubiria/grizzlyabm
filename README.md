# grizzlyabm

Welcome! This repository contains code information for an agent based model used to simualte grizzly bear movement and learning behaviour. The model was developed as part of a M.Sc. thesis and is in the process of being published (under Review as of February 2021). 

Details of the manuscript will be shared following publication. Until then, the corresponding thesis work can be found in the University of Victoria's institutional repository (https://dspace.library.uvic.ca:8443/).  

If you would like to use part of this code we ask that you please reference our work:

University of Victoria. Updated reference material will be made available once the corresponding publication is accepted

Any questions about the code should be addressed to Alejandra Zubiria Perez (aleja.zubiria@gmail.com)
