# grizzlyabm

Welcome! This repository contains code information for an agent based model used to simualte grizzly bear movement and learning behaviour. The model was developed as part of a M.Sc. thesis which can be found in the University of Victoria's institutional repository (https://dspace.library.uvic.ca:8443/). The second chapter of the thesis has been published in Ecological Modelling, and the third chapter is currently under review for publication (as of June 2021). 

If you would like to use part of this code we ask that you please reference our work.
