# grizzlyabm

Welcome! This repository contains code information for an agent based model used to simualte grizzly bear movement and learning behaviour. The model was developed as part of a M.Sc. thesis which can be found in the University of Victoria's institutional repository (https://dspace.library.uvic.ca:8443/). The second chapter of the thesis has been published in Ecological Modelling, and the third chapter is currently under review for publication (as of June 2021). 

In the compressed folder you will find the NetLogo files and input data necessary to run the code, as well as a readme file with instructions for setup and general notes. Any questions about the model or work in general can be addressed to Alejandra Zubiria Perez (aleja.zubiria@gmail.com)

If you would like to use part of this code we ask that you please reference our work:
